General Story:

NozamA Inc. is powerful... too powerful. They run the world, and their power has turned society into a consumer wasteland. But you plan to turn things around. You and your hacker partner are new recruits of the BLANK group, an underground organization working to take down all of NozamA's corporations one at a time. 

It's time for your first mission. The BLANK group manages to get you into the first of NozamA's buildings, but there's a problem. While there's no-one in the office, there's highly sensitive alarms. In order to allow your partner to successfully hack NozamA's system, mitigate any noise in the office building. The BLANK group is counting on you... along with the sake of the world as we know it.

Level Mechanics:

The player begins in the smallest of the three rooms, the break room. Inside are tv's, desks, chairs, 
And shelves. The player must distinguish which object is making noise in that room, which in this case will be a television (the largest object). Potential objects that are making noise will be colored, while the other objects in the room will remain white. In order to move to the next room, they must stop the noise by tapping that object. If the player incorrectly selects an object that is NOT making noise, the alarm will go off in less time. If the alarm goes off, the player has failed to successfully take down that office location.

The next room is a small office area. In the office area, there are various cubicles with desks, computers, chairs, printers, coffee machines, and more. The room is shaped somewhat like a maze with cubicles, to make it more difficult for the player to locate the next object that is making noise. The object that is making the noise is a computer. Once the player stops the noise on the computer, they open the door to the last room, the main office area. 

This area will include more inter-actable objects than the other two rooms. This coupled with its size, and a greater amount of cubicles, desks, chairs, and other objects will make it difficult to locate the object that is making the noise. In this room, the object will be a cell phone (the smallest of the three potential objects). If the player succeeds in finding each of the objects in each room before the alarm begins, they will have beaten the level, and successfully taken down that office location.
